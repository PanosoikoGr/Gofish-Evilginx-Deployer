sudo privileges

Domains configured and able to set DNS records (A records and DNS TXT for Let's Encrypt DNS challenge)

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Recommendations
SSL Certificate Generation: Uses Certbot with manual DNS challenge for GoPhish. Automating DNS record creation via Namecheap API is recommended for production.

Evilginx Configuration: After deployment, configure phishlets and settings within the Evilginx console.

Firewall: Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open inbound to the VPS.

Legal Usage Only: This script is intended for authorized security testing, education, and research. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.
